Just my attempt to implement a skiplist data structure based on these blog posts:
    http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_skip.aspx
    http://igoro.com/archive/skip-lists-are-fascinating/
in Cobra.

Current status:

I am trying to get started by implementing the interface with
contracts on top of a single list of the builtin List type and then
once I've got all the basics ironed out, then switching the underlying
implementation over.

Update: I've switched the underlying representation to a multi-level linked list
but I'm only using level 0 for now.
