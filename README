Just my attempt to implement a skiplist data structure based on this blog post:
    http://eternallyconfuzzled.com/tuts/datastructures/jsw_tut_skip.aspx
in Cobra.

Current status:

I am trying to get started by implementing the interface with
contracts on top of a single list of the builtin List type and then
once I've got all the basics ironed out, then switching the underlying
implementation over.
